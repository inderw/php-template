                            <p>The most important thing is that you want to learn something that interests you, because once you start learning, youll be with this topic for a while. Choosing something just because its popular or what others are doing isnt the way to go because if you dont have a true interest in it, youll lose the motivation to learn! Spend some time seriously looking into the different tech career paths before choosing one to go down.</p>

                            <p>I usually tell most people to start by learning HTML and CSS, then move into learning JavaScript. The reason is that JavaScript is used everywhere: frontend, backend, and even to build mobile apps. It has many use cases, which is why I think its smart to learn.</p>

                            <p>If you have an interest in coding and graphic design, then theres nothing to say you shouldnt learn skills in both areas. They often work hand-in-hand, so having knowledge and skills in both areas could be desirable for certain career paths. You could also think about pursuing something in between like UI design, which is a very in-demand career right now!

                                In general, having design skills along with coding skills is helpful. But its also okay to do one over the other. My advice would be to just get started! You can always change directions laterâ€¦ as long as youre changing directions to the final destination youre looking for!

                            <p>Now, in 2020, its a no-brainer: Python 3 is definitely the way to go. There are still some situations where picking up Python 2 might be advantageous, or you may just want to learn a little of the history and the differences between Python 2 and 3 for curiositys sake, but job-wise, Python 3 is the clear winner.</p>
