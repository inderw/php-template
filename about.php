    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
      In today's ever changing world, we have so many options for everything. It is no different when it comes to Real Estate. What company do I consider? How do I pick the right agent to assist me? Should I sell and buy properties without any professional guidance? For 90% of people, acquiring a property will be the single largest purchase they will make in their lifetime. A pretty big deal, I would say! So how do you decide who is going to partner up with you through this exciting real estate adventure?
      <br><br>
      It's completely your decision, but on that note, let me briefly introduce myself.
      <br><br>
      Saskatoon has been my home for over 20 years. I have seen this beautiful city grow and adapt quickly to many changes. I will be honest, I love the Saskatchewan summers and fall but could do without our record setting winters!!! I have a blended family of 5 kids, a huge bernadoodle, and a very supportive husband. We love to travel, watch our kids play sports and hang out at our lake cottage.
      <br><br>
      I started my real estate career in the custom home-building business. It was amazing to assist clients with their custom home, literally from the ground up. Everything from lot selection and blue print design, to interior design and final inspection on the completed home. It was such an amazing experience and what an advantage I had when I became a licensed REALTOR®.
      <br><br>
      I am now licensed in Residential, Commercial, and Farm Real Estate. I am known as one of Saskatoon's most authentic and trusted real estate advisors, and my knowledge, experience, and leadership have also led me down another path—real estate business coaching. It is so awesome to combine my love of real estate and passion to empower other female REALTORS® to be the best agents they can possibly be. Everyday is a new adventure, and I could not imagine doing anything else. My business is 80% referrals from past clients and associates.
      <br><br>
      My goal is to educate, guide and protect each and every client but to also make this the most stress free and fun real estate experience they will ever have (and yes, I did say fun)!
